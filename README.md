üöÄ Getting Started

    Clone this repository to your Jenkins instance:
            https://github.com/punishermortal/jenkins-shared-library.git

    Configure Jenkins to use the shared library:

        Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
        Scroll to Global Pipeline Libraries.
        Add a new library:
            Name: shared-library
            Source Code Management: Git
            Repository URL: <repository-url>

    Use the shared library in your pipeline:
        @Library('shared-library') _
        exampleFunction()

üìñ Usage

To use a function from this shared library in your pipeline, simply reference the library and call the desired function:

        @Library('shared-library') _
        pipeline {
            agent any
            stages {
                stage('Build') {
                    steps {
                        script {
                            exampleFunction() // Call a shared function
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
